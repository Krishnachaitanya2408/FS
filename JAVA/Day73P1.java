in the word. 
A word W is given to Prabhath. His objective is to eliminate every duplicate 
letter from W such that the resultant word R contains every unique letter from W
and did not contain any duplicate letters. 
And R should be at the top of the dictionary order.

NOTE:
-----
He is not allowed to shuffle the relative order of the letters of the word W to
create the word R.
